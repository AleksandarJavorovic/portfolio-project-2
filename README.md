## <a id="user-experience-ux-aa"></a>**User Experience (UX)**

The title/heading of the site and icons of HTML, CSS and JavaScript indicate what the user/player can expact from the quiz itself.

Under the intro, there are few lines of simple rules describing how it's going to work and what to pay attention to.

Right under the rules is the input field to enter the players name with a clear question:"What's your name?" and placeholder:"Enter your name". The input field is prefocused, making it even easier for the player without need to click it first to be able to enter the name.

The buttons are designed so that it is easily understandable what do they present and what are their functions. Appropriate styles and colors are used to make it even clearer.
